# Blankit

Wrap your game project together in Blankit!

Blankit is an all-in-one framework for making games in the Godot Engine. It's my way of giving back to the community!

# About

The idea here is you can just add Blankit to your project, click a few buttons, type some words, and boom, you have a lot of basic systems, such as saving data, loading scenes, and achievements built in!

This readme will be fleshed out soon when I have more to show, but feel free to star and watch to get updates on when this addon comes to life!
