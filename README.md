# Blankit

Wrap your Godot game project in a cozy Blankit!

Blankit is an all-in-one framework for making games in the Godot Engine. Blankit contains a ton of systems to allow you to jump straight into gameplay programming, without worrying about the backend.

It's my way of giving back to the community!

# About

The idea here is you can just add Blankit to your project, click a few buttons, type some words, and boom, you have a lot of basic systems, such as saving data, loading scenes, and achievements built in!

This README will be fleshed out soon when I have more to show, but feel free to star and watch to get updates on when this addon comes to life!

Features in-development:

- Game configurations so you can build and maintain a demo and showcase version all in one project file!
- Smooth scene loading with support for pre-built or custom transitions!
- A full saving system allowing you to store your player's data and options in JSON formatted save files!
- An achievement system with a backup local save file for API call failures.
- Remote Configurations that you can host on your website that Blankit will automatically download and allow you to pull from on launch.
- An API Handling system that allows you to plug-and-play SDKs after building the initial connection.
- A full localization tool allowing you to setup loc terms, export to csv files, and import back into Blankit!
- Pausing and time management.
- And more! (If I or you can think of anything!)
