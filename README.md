Wrap your Godot game project in a cozy Blankit!

An all-in-one framework for making games in the Godot Engine, Blankit contains a ton of tools to allow you to jump straight into gameplay programming, without worrying about the backend.

For more information, feel free to check out the [docs](https://blankit.tools)!

## Features coming soon! ‚è≥

- An achievement system with a backup local save file for API call failures.
- Remote Configurations that you can host on your website that Blankit will automatically download and allow you to pull from on launch.
