Wrap your Godot game project in a cozy Blankit!

Blankit is an all-in-one framework for making games in the Godot Engine. Blankit contains a ton of systems to allow you to jump straight into gameplay programming, without worrying about the backend.

It's my way of giving back to the community!

Unfortunately, due to this being a side-project, Blankit will only support the most modern version of Godot. We will not be porting or maintaining it for any older version of Godot. Feel free to fork it if you want to support it yourself!

# 📔 About 🤔

The idea here is you can just add Blankit to your project, click a few buttons, type some words, and boom, you have a lot of basic systems, such as saving data, loading scenes, and achievements built in!

This README will be fleshed out soon when I have more to show, but feel free to star and watch to get updates on when this addon comes to life!

# 🛠️ Features 🏗️

> ⚠️ These features are in active development and are **NOT** promised for v1!
