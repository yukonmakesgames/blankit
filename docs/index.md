After working on Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion, Turnip Boy Robs a Bank, and Hobnobbers, I realized how much time is wasted working on duplicates of the same few tools. Blankit is my attempt to resolve that for myself and anyone who chooses to adopt it!

Blankit is a bunch of simple versions of these tools with an intuitive workflow and an easy-to-use editor for quickly setting up and modifying your project's settings. Functions are easy to use and remember, and since the code is straightforward, it's easy to maintain and keep stable with new Godot updates.

## Getting started

You can install Blankit as an addon within your Godot project a few ways.

### Godot Asset Library (PENDING APPROVAL)

1. Open your Godot project
2. Navigate to the AssetLib tab
3. Search for "Blankit"
4. Download and install the addon

### Manual Installation

1. Download the [latest release][Blankit latest release] from the GitHub repository
2. Extract the contents
3. Drag the addons folder from the release into your project's directory, merging it with your existing one if you already have one

After you install Blankit in whichever way works for you, you can get started setting up its settings!

By default, once the plugin is enabled, Blankit will create a docked window on the top right of your editor. Navigate to that to explore all the options, and check out a tool's page in the docs for more details.
